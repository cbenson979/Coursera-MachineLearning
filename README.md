# Coursera-MachineLearning

This repository is intended to showcase my work as I progress through the Andrew Ng Coursera course on Machine learning (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

The course materials and coding exercises were performed in Octave/Matlab. In addition to completeing these exercies in the Octave/Matlab language, I've expanded the coding excersies into Python (using Juypter Notebooks) to better learn the material as well as showcase my abilities in Python.

The directories in this repository follow the week structure of the course. A week/topic breakdown is provided below and can be used as a table of contents

- Week 2: linear regression
- Week 3: logistic regression
- Week 4: Neural Networks 1, Representation
- Week 5: Neural Networks 2, Learning
